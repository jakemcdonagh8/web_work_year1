	<h1>CS15020: Practical 2: Writing some JavaScript</h1>

	<p>The scripts in this page may not
	work as you expect. You probably want to customise to
	your own taste anyway!</p>

	<p>The most important thing is that you make sure you understand 
	each script.</p>

	<hr />
	<p>
	The first script is called when the body loads. Can you customise
	it so that it prompts you for your name, then welcomes you
	personally? (we saw the <tt>prompt</tt> command in the lectures)</p>

	<hr />
	<p>Today is
	<script type="text/javascript">
<!-- // ======== Script 2: Dates and numbers as strings ======================
		Today = new Date();

		document.write(Today.getDate()+ "/" + (Today.getMonth() + 1) + "/" + Today.getFullYear());
		// Hint: remember what we said about types in JavaScript and
		// the overloading of the + operator
		// Remember also what we said abuot the Y2K bug
		// -->
	</script>
	</p>
	<p>Is this correct? If not, see if you can fix it!</p>

	<hr />
	<p>Can you add in a script here to write "good morning", 
	"good afternoon" or "good evening", as appropriate? Use the 
	same idea as above for the date.
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
	  var thishour = new Date();
	  var hournumber = thishour.getHours();
	  var hourresponse;
	  
	  if (hournumber<12) {
	  hourresponse = ("Good morning,")
	  } else if (hournumber<18) {
	  hourresponse = ("Good afternoon,")
	  } else {
	  hourresponse = ("Good evening,")
	  }
	  
	  document.write(hourresponse);
	 
	
	</script>
	</p>
	<hr />


	<p>The following is an example of processing input to an XHTML form
	using JavaScript. See if you can modify this to be a two-way exchange
	rate calculator.</p>
	<form action="">
		<p>
		Add VAT to how much?
		<input type="text" name="amount" size="7" />
		</p>
		<p>
		<input type="button" name="calc" onclick="calc_vat()" value="Calculate" />
		</p>
		<p>
		The total price to pay is
		<input type="text" name="result" size="7" />
		</p>
	</form>

	<hr />

	<p>This practical work is not part of the assessment for the
	course, but is designed to help you understand what we have
	covered in lectures.</p>
