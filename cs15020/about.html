	  <h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>
	  <p>In this write up, I will be discussing the entire project and my experiences of it in detail.</p>
	  
	  <p>To begin with, I personally found this assignment to be different in comparison to what I have done previously
	  in the past. I have never attempted to write a website with a mark-up language such as HTML before. I personally found this assignment
	  interesting as unlike alot of other types of assignments i've had thus far, I could see the progress I was making all the way through and not until the end.
	  Considering that I have attempted HTML before, I first began by attempting the practicals for HTML before I began on this main assignment. I particularly struggled
	  with the first practical. I found the HTML to be confusing due to my lack of experience with it. I eventually looked at the W3C HTML sheet in order to deduce what was
	  wrong and after a quick search I found that it was because it was lacking a specified xml namspace for the document. The JavaScript practical however, I found much
	  easier. I completed the majority of it within about 25 minutes. I, however, did not complete the VAT section of the practical as it had no relevance to the assignment at
	  hand. Before I began the assignment, I asked my lecturer, Angharad Shaw, on what version of HTML would be the easiest to use for someone who is a novice at the mark-up language.
	  I was reccomended to use XHTML, therefore the type of HTMl that was used for the entire assignment was XHTML.</p>
	  
	  <p>I feel like the biggest issue I had with this particular assignment was trying to learn how to structure a consistent HTML page. In order to make an effective start, I
	  took at look at the HTML mark up and CSS from Angharad Shaw's example website which can be found on the index. From there I started to slowly input the HTML code, often 
	  refreshing the page so that I could see how the attributes were affecting the site individually. I felt that I was learning alot of useful information about how to properly 
	  design a website from doing this. As the structure started to form, I started to change the previous HTML and started to customise the CSS in order to make it appear different.
	  At this point, I used the W3C CSS reference sheet in order to find out the information that I needed. For example, I found out how to center the text for titles as well as the 
	  colours for the fonts and background. By being able to play around and change each individual component I think I was able to gain a better understanding of how to properly use 
	  both HTML and CSS.</p>
	  
	  <p>I personally felt that the JavaScript portion of the assignment was the easiest part. Adding in the piece of JavaScript to display a message to the user with the time of day 
	  being the variable as well as displaying to the user the time of when the index document was last modified took me about 20 minutes overall (considering that the same task was
	  asked of me in practical 2). However, my solution of displaying the message was in another separate output textbox, which was not the most elegant solution. I asked my lecturer
	  about this once again and she gave me a possible solution to explore, using a document.getElementbyId instead of the second textbox. I pursued this and eventually found out how to 
	  properly use this function. From this point on, I found the rest of the assignment to be fairly easy, considering that I now have had experience with both HTML and CSS</p>
	  
	  <p>If I were to have a second attempt at this assignment, I would focus on some of the more advanced concepts in HTML in order to make my site look more attractive</p>
