<!-- My past work experiences and extra curricular activities -->	
	  <h3>Work Experience/Extra Curricular Activities</h3>
	  <p>Below is a list of the past experiences of work and anything extra curricular that I have done:</p>
	  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	  <li>Georgetown After School Club - In my spare time, during my GCSE year, I did voluntary work at an after school club
	  for a primary school that was local to where I live. My job title was a play worker, and the responsibilities 
	  included were supervising and entertaining the children and making sure that no harm came to them. This helped me
	  develop on my communication skills as well as helping me be able to understand a child's needs. This also shows that I am
	  trustworthy considering that I have been allowed to work with children for a number of years not only in Georgetown, but also
	  in several other nurseries and after school activities.</li> 
	  <li>Suite Shop Wales - I have also worked voluntarily at an Upholstery and Bespoke where my tasks included having to strip the cloth and sew
	  the cloth of various types of furniture for many customers on a day to day basis. This job was physically demanding and taxing, showing me how
	  rewarding a hard job can be. Despite this, I have also learnt some upholstery and sewing on a basic level</li>
	  <li>Performing - Throughout my GCSE/A level years I have also performed at many different types of concerts, performing from gigs to festivals as well as performing 
	  as part of a choir in churches. This has allowed me to develop on my musical skills as well as my understanding on how to perform as an effective group. This has resulted in
	  me developing on my team-working skills.</li>
	  <li>Research and Code in spare time - During my A-levels I often coded new projects and have tried my hand at different types of languages throughout my two years at college. I feel that 
	  this has helped me gain a better understanding of coding in general. I also consistently research into new developments of technology as a whole, from new advancments of medicine, to recent
	  developments of AI as well as research into the business aspects of the gaming industry. Computers have always been a big passion for me and I enjoy researching every aspect of them, keeping
	  up to date with all forms of it.
